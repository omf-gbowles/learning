Information like this is important, especially when making predictions.\n",

Interquartile range, or IQR, is another way of measuring spread that's less influenced by outliers. IQR is also often used to find outliers. If a value is less than `Q1 - 1.5 X IQR` or greater than `Q3 + 1/5 X IQR`, it's considered an outlier. In fact, this is how the lengths of the whiskers in a `matplotlib` box plot are calculated."
